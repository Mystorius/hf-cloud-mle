HF Cloud MLE Assignment

Thank you for the opportunity to complete this assignment.
I opted to write most of the answers for fine-tuning, data formatting and parameters configuration not directly as a response to the questions, but as a general explanation of the steps I took to complete the assignment. 
This way, I can provide the information and guide to everyone in and around the ðŸ¤—-community.

## Question 1 - Fine-tuning
Please go to the folder `part1`.

## Question 2 - Container Creation and Testing Exercise
Please go to the folder `part2`.
