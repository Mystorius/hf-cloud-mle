# Fine-tuning a Large Language Model (LLM)

This guide will help you fine-tune a large language model (LLM) like Mistral-7B on your internal datasets. We'll cover memory requirements, data formatting, optimal parameters, and model evaluation. Let's dive in!

---

## **Memory Requirements**

The memory requirement for running a model like Mistral-7B or any LLM varies depending on the task, whether you're running inference or training.

1. **Inference**:
   - Mistral-7B has about **7.24 billion parameters**. The model uses BF16 (bfloat16) precision, which is **16 bits** or **2 bytes** wide, to store the parameters.
   - Total memory needed for inference = `7.24 billion parameters * 2 bytes ≈ 15GB of GPU memory`.
   - On a **T4 GPU**, which has **16GB of memory**, you can run inference without any issues.

Pro Tip: You can use techniques like **quantization** to reduce the model size and memory requirements for inference. We have an extensive guide on [Optimizing LLMs for Speed and Memory](hthttps://discuss.huggingface.co/t/memory-requirements-for-running-llm/57282) that you might find helpful. Also have a look at the [Hugging Face Model Hub Mistral 7b](https://huggingface.co/models?other=base_model:quantized:mistralai/Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.3) where you can find instruction tunes models that are already quantized by our community members.
   
2. **Training**:
   - Training is more memory-intensive because you need to store activations, gradients, and optimizer states. A rough estimate is **3x to 4x** the model size.
   - For Mistral-7B: Total memory for training ≈ `3 * 15 ≈ 45GB`.
   - Since your T4 GPU has only 16GB of memory, you would need to use techniques like **gradient checkpointing**, **LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation)**, **PEFT (Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning)**, and `bitsandbytes` library for memory efficiency.

#### **Code Example for Inference with Mistral-7B**
The notebook [Mistral7b-inference](./Mistral7b-Inference.ipynb) provides a full example of how to run inference with Mistral-7B on a T4 GPU. 
We'll use Hugging Face’s `transformers` libary to load the model and tokenizer, and run inference on a sample text.

We'll use Hugging Face’s `transformers`, `datasets`, and `peft` libraries to load the model, tokenizer, and dataset, and fine-tune the model on a custom dataset.

## **Deployment Architectures for Real-Time Systems**
When deploying an LLM for real-time customer interactions on platforms like AWS or GCP, you have multiple options based on your needs, infrastructure, and desired level of control. 
You can either **build it yourself** by setting up custom API endpoints or leverage **managed services** that simplify scaling and reduce operational overhead.

1. **Build It Yourself: Custom API Endpoint**

   You can deploy the model as a custom API using containerized solutions like **Docker** or **Kubernetes**. 
   This approach gives you more flexibility and control over how the model is deployed, updated, and scaled. 

   - **Amazon EC2** instances can host the model as a REST API for real-time inference.
   - **GCP Compute Engine** or **GKE (Google Kubernetes Engine)** can also be used to deploy models as scalable microservices.
   - **AWS Elastic Load Balancer (ELB)** or **GCP Load Balancing** can manage incoming traffic and ensure high availability.

   **Pros**:
   - Full control over the deployment environment.
   - Flexibility to customize scaling, auto-scaling, and resource allocation.

   **Cons**:
   - Requires managing infrastructure, handling scaling, load balancing, and maintenance.
   - More complex, especially for non-experts.

2. **Managed Services: AWS and GCP Endpoints**

   If you prefer a more hands-off approach, you can use managed services like:

   - **AWS SageMaker Real-Time Inference Endpoints**: These endpoints are fully managed, providing easy deployment of machine learning models with auto-scaling and monitoring out-of-the-box. 
   Ideal for real-time customer engagement where low latency and high throughput are essential.
   - **GCP Vertex AI Endpoints**: Similar to SageMaker, Vertex AI allows you to deploy models at scale with minimal setup, offering auto-scaling, versioning, and monitoring.
   - **Hugging Face Inference Endpoints**: You can deploy LLMs directly on Hugging Face's platform with support for real-time inference, scaling, and monitoring.
  
   **Pros**:
   - Reduced operational complexity.
   - Built-in scaling, auto-scaling, and load balancing.
   - Great for teams that want to focus on model performance and evaluation rather than infrastructure management.

   **Cons**:
   - Limited flexibility for custom setups.
   - May incur higher operational costs compared to custom deployments for long-running or high-volume applications.

#### **Reducing Latency and Increasing Throughput**

Here are strategies you can employ to reduce latency and maximizing throughput:

1. **GPU Acceleration**:
   - Use **GPUs** for faster inference, especially for large models. GPU's will be more expensive but will provide a significant speedup.

1. **Model Optimization**:
   - **Quantization**: Convert the model to lower precision using tools like `bitsandbytes` (like we used for training), which can drastically reduce inference time and memory usage.
   - **Distillation**: Use a smaller distilled version of the model that retains performance but can process requests faster. Have a look at the [Hugging Face Model Hub Mistral 7b](https://huggingface.co/models?other=base_model:quantized:mistralai/Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.3) where you can find instruction tunes models that are already distilled by our community members.

2. **Load Balancing & Auto-scaling**:
   - **Horizontal Scaling**: Use auto-scaling to deploy multiple instances of the model across several GPUs/CPUs. Services like **AWS Elastic Load Balancing (ELB)** or **GCP Load Balancer** can distribute the incoming traffic evenly.
   - **Caching**: For repetitive requests, implement response caching mechanisms using tools like **Amazon ElastiCache** or **Redis** to reduce the load on the model inference.

3. **Edge Deployment**:
   - For latency-critical use cases, consider **edge deployment** to serve the model closer to the user’s location.

### Conclusion
I would recommend starting with the **easiest deployment option** to quickly test and iterate. 

**Testing fast and often is critical** to successfully fine-tuning your model for real-world applications. Rapid iteration enables you to tweak your LLM based on real-time results, ensuring it aligns with your specific use cases. As your system evolves, you can later explore more customized deployment options if needed.

For additional insights and best practices, I highly recommend exploring the excellent guides on **[ml-ops.org](https://ml-ops.org)**, which provide valuable resources for optimizing machine learning operations, deployments, and iteration workflows.
